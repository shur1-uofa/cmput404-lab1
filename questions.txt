Question 2
As expected, it is not installed 


Question 3
2.31.0


Question 4
Well it's not installed so the difference is:
Outside of the virtual environment, the python script does not run due to an ModuleNotFoundError


Question 5
301 - Moved Permanently
Pass in "http://www.google.com" to get 200 status code


Question 6
301 - Moved Permanently
Both curl -i & -iL options return this info


Question 7
The -X option sets the HTTP method. In our case, it set it to the POST method. The default value is GET

What changed : 
Date of request (obviously)
Unique ID 
Remote Port # 

The HTTP method : 
Without -X POST, the response data says it's GET 
With -X POST, the response data says it's POST

For -X POST, the response data says the content length is 3 and type application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Also, it includes this gibberish in the form contents of response data:
    <DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
    <DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
Or in more human readable format 
<DT> X: <i><type 'instance'></i>
<DD> MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')

This likely came from the -d option in the curl command


The POST method is useful for creating or updating some data on a server as its name implies
